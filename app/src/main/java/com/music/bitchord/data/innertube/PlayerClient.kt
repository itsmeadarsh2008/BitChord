/**
 * One client identity for the `player` endpoint.
 *
 * Identities arrive in the imported service file rather than living here:
 * which clients are answered changes without notice — an identity that
 * returns `OK` today answers `LOGIN_REQUIRED` next month, and one that is
 * merely *old* is refused with a bare HTTP 400 before playability is even
 * considered. So this is a list to walk rather than a constant — see
 * [StreamResolver] and [com.music.bitchord.data.service.ServiceConfig].
 *
 * Three things travel together and must not be separated:
 *
 *  - **[userAgent]**, which the media fetch has to repeat. The stream host
 *    bakes the client into the URL as `c=`/`cver=` and compares it against
 *    the headers of the request that comes back for the bytes.
 *  - **[origin]**, sent only by the browser-shaped clients, and pointing at
 *    the host that client actually runs on. Native app clients send none, and
 *    sending one anyway is as wrong as omitting it from a web client.
 *  - **[needsSignatureTimestamp]**, which decides whether the player request
 *    has to carry a timestamp lifted from the service's player JavaScript.
 *    The clients that need it are the ones that answer with ciphered formats.
